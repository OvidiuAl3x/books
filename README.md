# MERN Stack Book Catalog Project

This MERN stack project combines robust functionality with elegant design, utilizing Tailwind CSS for styling, Material-UI's DataGrid for efficient data presentation, and React Icons for enhanced visual appeal. SweetAlert2 handles alerts seamlessly, enriching the user experience.

The backend, powered by Express.js and Node.js, ensures secure and efficient operation with essential middleware and robust HTTP communication between frontend and backend.

### Key Features:

- **Home Page Overview**: Users can browse through a comprehensive collection of books, apply filters by categories, years, authors, or use the search functionality, all harmoniously integrated to refine searches based on multiple criteria simultaneously.

- **Admin Features**: Admin users benefit from an enhanced navigation bar for efficient book catalog management, including editing capabilities directly from the navigation interface.

- **User Authentication**: The login page serves as the gateway to authenticated actions such as adding books to the wishlist. Non-logged-in users seamlessly transition to the registration page when attempting restricted actions.

- **Wishlist Management**: Logged-in users can create and manage wishlists, adding books for future reference and exploration.

- **Book Editing and Creation**: The Edit Books Page features a powerful DataGrid from Material-UI, enabling admins to manage and organize book data intuitively. The Create Book Page offers a user-friendly form for adding new books with live image previews and category selection.

- **Book Details and Reviews**: Individual book pages provide detailed information, including synopses, reviews, and user feedback. The reviews section allows logged-in users to contribute, edit, or delete reviews, fostering community engagement and discussions.

- **Footer Navigation**: Includes project details, a logo, and links to social media platforms for easy access to essential pages.

This project aims to deliver an engaging and user-friendly experience, combining functionality with a visually appealing interface.
